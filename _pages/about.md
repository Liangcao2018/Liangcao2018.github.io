I am a Ph.D. student studying [Chemical and Biological Engineering (CHBE)](https://chbe.ubc.ca/) at UBC under the supervision of [Prof. Bhushan Gopaluni](https://dais.chbe.ubc.ca) and [Prof. Yankai Cao](https://optimal.chbe.ubc.ca/). I received my BASc and MASc in Automation/Control Engineering from [Beijing University of Chemical and Technology](https://www.buct.edu.cn/) in China under the supervision of [Prof. Youqing Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Youqing-Wang-2). I am also a joint master student at the [University of Duisburg-Essen](https://www.uni-due.de/en/index.php) (Germany) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Steven X. Ding](https://www.uni-due.de/aks/stevending_en.php) and a research assistant at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Prof.Fan Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m-vMDFkAAAAJ&hl=en). My previous research includes fault diagnosis and control theory. My current Ph.D. research interests focus on process monitoring, causal discovery and inference.
